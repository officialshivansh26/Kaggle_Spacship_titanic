# Spaceship Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains code for predicting the survival of passengers on the Spaceship Titanic using the XGBoost machine learning model. The goal is to predict whether a person will be transported successfully or not based on different features such as age, gender, ticket class, etc.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Spaceship Titanic dataset, which is available on [Kaggle]https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/data. The dataset includes information about passengers such as their name, age, gender, ticket class, fare, and the target variable indicating whether they survived the transport.

## XGBoost Model

### Model Implementation

- Implementation of an XGBoost classifier for survival prediction.
- Hyperparameters are tuned using Optuna for optimal performance.
